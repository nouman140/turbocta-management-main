          </h3>
          <ul className="mx-6 list-disc text-black">
            <li>
              If you cancel your report order after payment but before we have
              begun the filing process, you are entitled to a full refund.

          <ul className="mx-6 list-disc text-black">
            <li>
              Once a report is filed, we are unable to offer a refund. We

          </h3>
          <ul className="mx-6 list-disc text-black">
            <li>
              If you have purchased an annual compliance package and wish to
              request a refund after filing only your initial report, we will
              refund the difference between the cost of the annual package and
              the one-time report fee.
            </li>
            <li>
              {" "}
              Please note, a processing fee of $25 will be deducted from this
              refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              No refunds can be offered if you have already filed a free updated
              report under the annual package. The cost of an additional
              standard updated report exceeds the difference between the
              one-time and ongoing compliance package costs.
